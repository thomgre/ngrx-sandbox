Resources can be handling using the same strategy that 
nativelang module propose. 

We can build resource string file based on xml format
it would be integrated with ease in the application
with a simple download.

The file can be compressed with a simple compress with
a large benefit beneath the fact that is made of a lot of xml 
tags and terms that are repeated many tims.

**Example**

Suppose a italian resource file would be called like i18.it.xml

<resources>
  <string name="Login">Accesso</string>
  <string name="Register">Registrati</string>
  ..
  ..
</resources>
